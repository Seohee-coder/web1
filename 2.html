  <h2>The Red-Headed League</h2>
  <p>  I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the
     autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very
     stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. With an
     apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled
     me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.</p>
  <p>"You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson,"
       he said cordially.</p>

  <p>"I was afraid that you were engaged."</p>

  <p>"So I am. Very much so."</p>

  <p>"Then I can wait in the next room."</p>

  <p>"Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and
       helper in many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that
       he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also."</p>
